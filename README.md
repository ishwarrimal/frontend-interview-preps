## About

Hi, I am _Ishwar Rimal_ and I maintain this repo.
I have close to **8 years** of experience in the software industry. I've been working mostly at startups and have recently joined a product-based MNC.

Recently after giving a few interviews and preparing an interview guide for myself, I thought of making it public for everyone to access and get benefitted, and it's turning out to be useful to a lot of people.

This repo is open to everyone for contribution.

I am looking for a couple of folks to help me maintain this repo. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.

## Some Feedback this repo got  
- A special thanks to Ishwar Rimal for his outstanding contribution! His Frontend Interview Repository has been my secret weapon during interview preparations. Ishwar, your dedication to knowledge sharing is truly inspiring, and it's made a world of difference in my career.
